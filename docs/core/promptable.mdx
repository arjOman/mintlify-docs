## <Icon size={24} icon="robot" iconType="solid" /> Agent <span style={{color: "gray", fontWeight: "normal", fontSize: "1rem"}}>v1</span>

An *instruction-following* language model combined with an [agent algorithm]() takes the user's query and *strategically* interacts with [apps]() and [knowledgebases]() to fulfill the *desired* outcome. 

With [reasoning]() abilities, it can verify the rationality of its thoughts and rethink its decisions.

It can also ask the user for [clarification]() if needed, on the way.

<Note>
    Instruction-following language models are finetuned to abide by instructions given by the system or user. Agentic algorithms provide complex instructions for the language models to follow.

    Therefore, Chat models are not supported for agents.
